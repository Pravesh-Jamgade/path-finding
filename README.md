Path finding and Planning algorithms:
a) dfs
b) bfs
c) Dijkstra
d) Bellman Ford
e) A Star

Improvements: 
1. Tracking exact path and removing extra edge that do not leads to destination.
2. Adding Animation using some c++ cross platform library.
3. Adding other variants of existing path finding algorithms.
